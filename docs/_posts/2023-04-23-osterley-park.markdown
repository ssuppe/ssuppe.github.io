The <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/london/osterley-park-and-house" target="_new">Osterley Park and House</a> is another go-to site to visit as a family. Set out near Heathrow, it's about an hour away from where we live in North London.

The site is kind of the perfect introductory site to what the National Trust has to offer. With acres of parkland, a beautiful historic house, a walled garden, an adventure playground, 2 cafes and even a *farm*, Wimpole has a lot to offer.

The park is a <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/london/osterley-park-and-house/visiting-osterley-park-with-your-dog" target="_new">"two pawprint" site</a>, but honestly I'm not sure what else you could ask for. Officially they're allowed basically everywhere except the house (which is beautfiful), and are expected to be on leads and under close control. 

After parking, there is a 10 minute walk to the "main" house/cafe/shops. The Stables Cafe has all the wholesome National Trust food you've come to expect, and dogs are allowed inside if it's raining. There are always water bowls out for the pups. One of our daughters is gluten and dairy free (mild intolerance, nothing serious), and there's always an option for her which we appreciate - usually a curry/chili or baked potatoes.

Once in the park, there's a few paths you can take with your pup around a large-ish lake. If you do the lake with no detours/breaks, it probably takes about 30 minutes. It's a beautiful, flat walk that's easy for everyone (although it's mostly not paved). There is a large area where the dogs can be officially off the lead. While it's beautiful and relatively easy, there aren't a lot of places curated to stop and picnic or anything. If the ground is dry, there are plenty of places to perch if you've brought a blanket. 

Osterley Park is also known as a great place to cycle. Our kids bring their scooters/bikes - some of the paths are a bit "rough" (not paved) but I think this teaches an adventurous spirit. :) 

The <a href="https://nt.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website/national/regions/london/places/osterley-park-and-house/pdf/osterley-park-map.pdf">official map</a> outlines the house and the "off lead" areas pretty well.
