The <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cambridgeshire/wimpole-estate" target="_new">Wimpole Estate National Trust</a> is one of our go-to sites to visit as a family, even before we had a dog. Near Cambridge, it's a little over an hour away from where we live in North London, so you can have a relaxed morning and still make it there by lunchtime in the car.

The site is kind of the perfect introductory site to what the National Trust has to offer. With acres of parkland, a beautiful historic house, a walled garden, an adventure playground, 2 cafes and even a *farm*, Wimpole has a lot to offer.

There are loads of places to take your dog, but it's important to note you can't go everyhwere. Officially, Wimpole is a <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cambridgeshire/wimpole-estate/visiting-wimpole-estate-with-your-dog" target="new">"two pawprint" site</a>, and "dogs are welcome in the Parkland, Stables area and outdoor terrace at the Old Rectory restaurants. Only assistance dogs are permitted into the Hall, Gardens and Home Farm."

We like to think about Wimpole as 2 distinct 'halves.' One half is the dog-friendly half - it has the huge estate and parkland, with loads of beautiful walks, where you can see lakes, bridges, sheep and even a folly. The Old Rectory and Stables Cafe restaurant is accessible from this side, and there are plenty of places to eat with your dog, although I'm not sure you can bring them inside if it's raining! (Something for me to figure out next time)

The other side has the more 'curated' experience. Dogs are not allowed on this side, except for assistance dogs. There's the Home Farm (with real pigs, chickens, and more), the Farm Cafe, the Adventure Playground, and the gorgeous walled garden. If you're coming to Wimpole for family activities, they are almost always on this side, so if you bring your pup you'll likely have to split up.

There is an <a href="https://nt.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website/national/regions/cambridgeshire/places/wimpole-estate/pdf/wimpole-estate-map.pdf">official map</a>, and here's my drawing of where dogs are allowed. The darkened areas are where dogs are allowed. (Please visit the official map for the exact details):
