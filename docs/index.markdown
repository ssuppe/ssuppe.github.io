National Trust websites have lots of information about dog-friendliness, but often requires reading each site's super-long page, or clicking around to find the specific page about dogs.

This map shows all the dog information for every National Trust site front-and-center, taken directly from their websites, to save you time clicking around. Click on a marker to find out more.

Information may go out-of-date - click on each site's link to get the most up-to-date information. Click on the title to go to the main site, or any other sites listed.
