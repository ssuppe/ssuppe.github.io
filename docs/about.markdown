## This is Taffy
![Taffy the Dog](/assets/images/about/taffy.jpg){:class="img-responsive",  width="50"}

Taffy is our good dog, and the fifth member of our "family 4-squad." We love going to National Trusts as a family, and we take Taffy with us every chance we get. We live in London, so most of the Natonal Trusts we go to are not so far away from there. However, every time we go away in the UK, be it Kent, Sussex, Suffolk, or even further afield like Cornwall or Scotland, we always fit in at least one National Trust trip.

Before every trip, I take a look at the NT mobile app or Google Maps and find some National Trusts along our route.  But the challenge has always been quickly reviewing which sites are dog friendly, ruling out the ones that are not, and making some decision as to which one is best for us. The National Trust has a fair amount of information on just how dog-friendly a site is, but it often requires reading each site's super-long page, or finding the specific page about dogs.

This site aims to make that information easier to find. The map includes all mentions about dogs on each National Trust site's website, and I aim to make a little blog about each of our visits. I hope you find it useful!
